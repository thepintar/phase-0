# OO Basics: Student


# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].
# This challenge took me [#] hours.


# Pseudocode
=begin
//RELEASE 1
CREATE 5 instances of a student class where the name variable is the student's name and the scores variable is a list of their test scores

CREATE an array of students where every element in the array is a different instance of a student class

//RELEASE 2
ACCESS every element in each student's grades array and sum the elements and divide by the length of the array.
IF that average is within the following ranges, assign the corresponding letter to the student object as an instance variable
A for >=90%, B for >=80%, C for >= 70%, D for >= 60% and F for < 60%

//RELEASE 3
ITERATE over the array of students.
IF the student's first name as provided in the search matches a student's name in the array
  RETURN the position of the student's name in the array.
ELSE
  RETURN -1

//RELEASE 4
SORT the array of students names by name
CREATE a variable that stores the midpoint of the array
CREATE a variable that stores the minimum searchable index of the array
CREATE a variable that stores the maximum searchable index of the array
WHILE the minimum index is LESS THAN OR EQUAL to the maximum index
  IF the value of the search name is EQUAL TO the name at the midpoint of the array
    RETURN the index of the name at the midpoint
  ELSIF the value of the search name is LESS THAN the name at the midpoint of the array
    SET the minimum searchable index to the midpoint incremented by 1
  ELSE
  SET the maximum searchable index to the midpoint decremented by 1
RETURN student name not found
