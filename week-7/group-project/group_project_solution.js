// User Story:
// As a user, I want to be able to take a group of numbers and do three things to it:
// I want to be able to take the sum of all the numbers, I want to be able to find the mean of all the numbers, and I want to be able to find
// the median of all the numbers. I want to be able to do all of these things individually with functions called sum, mean and median.
// Keep in mind that my group of numbers might contain an odd number of numbers or an even number of numbers. This will impact the median function.
