##What does puts do?
'puts' outputs a string but returns a nil value.

##What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is a number without any decimal (i.e. 1, 2, 1000, 50) and a float is a number with a decimal and the tenths, hundredths, thousandths (etc) place thereafter (i.e. 1.0, 2.2, 3.9, 500.126).

##What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
An float division will return the same value that a standard calculator would while an integer division will return the number rounded down to the nearest integer. An integer division essentially returns the result down to the decimal and then discards the remainder. Its useful to think about real world objects when considering this, as most real-world things are best used whole. If you need to split nine people between two cars, you wouldn't put four people in each car and cut the final person in half. Integer division would simply tell you to put four people in each car. The final person will either have to ride in the trunk or take the bus.
