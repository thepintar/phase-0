##What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is a rudimentary layout of a website's design. Although its meant to be simple and only just hint at the content within the site, it should be a very clear roadmap illustrating how the website is to be navigated and where crucial elements should live on each page. You ought to be able to give someone the wireframe for your site and clearly simulate the action of browsing through the many pages using just paper and sketches.

##What are the benefits of wireframing?
Wireframing allows the designer to jump into basic site design without needing to visualize late-in-the-game elements like colors and fonts. It makes it a bit easier to conceptualize just the way content is organized on the page, and could make it easier to construct an initial design. It eliminates distraction.

##Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
I did enjoy the wireframing process. It was really the first time I started to feel like the site existed (while clearly not existing yet). Creating the site map earlier still wasn't a concrete enough action to make it feel real, but now I can see the outlines of what will soon be accessible on the web. It's kind of exciting!

##Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I stuck with my first idea, because I know I have a tendency to complicate and I wanted to keep it simple for my first site.

##What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
I asked questions like: 
What is a wireframe? (found the answers in the linked material)
What is the proper formatting? (found the answers in the linked material)
Is it better to do it digitally or can I draw it on paper? (ditto)

##Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
Nothing in this section was tedious- I enjoyed visualizing the site structure and drawing it out on paper. I could get used to this.
