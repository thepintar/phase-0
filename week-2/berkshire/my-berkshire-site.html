- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
I'm not going to say it was exhilerating, but there is something exciting about putting learning into practice, no matter how simple or small it may seem. Taking the first step is...the first step. Its just up from here!
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It was cool. It was fine. I dunno. It was fun to research little elements I wasn't sure about and translate them directly into a website before my own eyes.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I think my peer partner and I did pretty well. Its fairly easy to keep everything bland. I appreciated the sample page included that encouraged a completely oatmeal design.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
The good is that its very straightforward. The whole tree/branch metaphor is very apt, and keeps everything neatly organized. It makes a lot of sense that it was created to share simple documents because it IS simple. However therein lies its weakness, in that it's much trickier to get flashy at all just in html. Convoluted tables within tables (I'm lookin at you early geocities website from my youth) get messy quickly and apparently a better workflow exists in a language named CSS... Source say anyhow.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Tricks? Like memory tricks? I just...remember things I need to remember. I don't have anything fancy. I just write notes as I learn, reference the notes often and practice. It's also nice that so many of the tags look like what they mean.
